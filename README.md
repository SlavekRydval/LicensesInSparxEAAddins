# Licenses in Sparx EA Addins

Visual Studio .NET Solution that supports showing error with licenses

1) Run Visual Studion (2017) as Administrator.
2) Build solution
3) Run both .reg files
4) Run Sparx EA (the addins should be loaded - you can check it in Manage Addins configuration dialog)
5) Now enter new licence key FERDA as private (not shared). It will be OK.
6) Now enter new licence key MRAVENEC as private (not shared). This licence key will be OK but rewrites the previous one. But why? My mistake or the mistake in Sparx?
